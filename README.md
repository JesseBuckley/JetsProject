# JetsProject


# Project Description

-The JetsProject takes user input to cycle through a menu of 9 options until the user selects (9) which ends the program. See the menu example in How to Run. 

-Using a array list when the program runs 5 generic Jets are generated into the array.

# How to Run

-You run the program by opening the JetsApplication class file. It is the only file containing a main method.

-You will be prompted by this menu:

---(1) List fleet

---(2) Fly all jets

---(3) View fastest jet

---(4) View jet with longest range

---(5) Load all Cargo Jets

---(6) Dogfight!

---(7) Add a jet to Fleet

---(8) Remove a jet from Fleet

------(9) Quit

-Once you are finished with selecting anything you like select quit to end the program.

# Class Structure

-The project uses a abstract "Jet" class which is then extended by a "PassengerJet" class and also a "PilotOnlyJet" class.

-Using the classes above there are two subclasses of PassengerJet and one subclass of PilotOnlyJet.

-There are two interfaces. One for PassengerJet's subclass "CargoJet". The other for PilotOnlyJet's subclass "FighterJet".

# Technologies/Topics used

-Sublime text editor

-Java JVM/JDK 

-Eclipse IDE/Eclipse README

# Lessons Learned
-The homework just last week I was struggling to call non-static methods. That is now a problem of the past, there are and were more difficult challenges ahead.

-I was challenged by this assignment mentally more than I have been up until now. I am learning more in the past few weeks then I could of imagined.

-Using all the different types of class files was not the worst thing once I got used to it.

-The logic for a lot of the methods in this project I was stumped by for a bit of time, but they were all solvable with some review. 

----I will update this line if I find enough time to do the stretch goals----
